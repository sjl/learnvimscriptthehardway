[Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][book] is a short book for users of the Vim editor
who want to learn how to customize Vim.

Before reading this book you should be comfortable using Vim and know what terms
like "buffer", "window" and "insert mode" mean.

The book is divided into three sections.

The first covers basic Vim commands that you can use in your `~/.vimrc` file to
customize Vim quickly and easily.

The second looks more deeply at Vimscript as a programming language, covering
things like variables, comparisons, and functions.

The third walks through the creation of a sample plugin intended for
distribution to other Vim users.
